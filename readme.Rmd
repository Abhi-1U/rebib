rebib is a spun-off package from [texor](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/texor).

The decision to do this is the fact that the bibliography section 
in texor package was expanding significantly, enough to deserve a dedicated space.

-   Reads bib chunks to produce a very close BibTeX equivalent
-   Title and author are usually mandatory fields
-   URL, ISBN, publisher, pages and year are optional fields and will be enabled when relevant
-   Rest of the data is stored in `"journal"`(internally) and `"publisher"`(when writing BibTeX file)
-   Ignores commented LaTeX code 
-   Citation tracker
-   Logging of events
-   Bibliography Aggregation

## Installation

install the mainline version from CRAN with:
```r
install.packages('rebib')
```

install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Abhi-1U/rebib")
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Abhi-1U/rebib")
```

## General Usage for Rjournal articles
 here is a quick example to use rebib package with a sample Rjournal article
(included with the package [inst/article](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/rebib/tree/master/inst/article))
``` r
wd <-  system.file("article", package = "rebib")
# for files without BibTeX source
rebib::handle_bibliography(wd)
cat(readLines(paste(wd,"example.bib",sep="/")),sep = "\n")
# for files with BibTeX source as well as embedded enntries
rebib::aggregate_bibliography(wd)
cat(readLines(paste(wd,"example.bib",sep="/")),sep = "\n")
```

## General Usage for any other tex/bbl file
 here is a quick example to use rebib package with a sample bbl file
(included with the package [inst/article](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/rebib/tree/master/inst/article))
``` r
bbl_file <-  "" # /path/to/bbl_file
rebib::biblio_convertor(file_path = bbl_file)
cat(readLines(xfun::with_ext(bbl_file, "bib")),sep = "\n")
```


## Step By Step Usage
 This procedure is meant for debugging errors and finding out what went wrong.
``` r
wd <-  system.file("article", package = "rebib")
file_name <- rebib:::get_texfile_name(wd)
bib_items <- rebib:::extract_embeded_bib_items(wd,file_name)
# for debugging single entry
rebib:::bibliography_parser(bib_items[1])
# for multiple entries
rebib:::bib_handler(bib_items[1:2])
```



## Sample Conversion 

Embedded bibliography :
```
\bibitem[R Core Team]{R}
R Core Team
\newblock R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing
\newblock \emph{R Foundation for Statistical Computing}, Vienna, Austria \penalty0 2016.
\newblock URL : \url{https://www.R-project.org/}, ISBN 3-900051-07-0

```
generated BibTeX :
```
@book{R,
author = {{R Core Team}},
title = {{R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing}},
publisher = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing Vienna Austria},
year = {2016},
url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
isbn = {3-900051-07-0}
}
```
