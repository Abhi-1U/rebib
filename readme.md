# rebib : Parse/Convert embedded LaTeX bibliography to BibTex

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

rebib is a spun off package from
[texor](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/texor) project.

The decision to do this was based on the fact that the bibliography
section in texor package was expanding significantly, enough itself to
have its own package.

-   Reads bib chunks to produce minimum viable bibtex equivalent
